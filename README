INSTALLATION AND USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
    * Install SQL::Catalog
         perl Makefile.PL
         make
         make install

        make test is not too easy to do.. Sigh.

        You will need to download and install SQL::Statement unless you are
        using CPAN.pm which will detect it as a prereq and install it for
        you.

    * Use or create and contribute a script to create a table named
    sql_catalog. Scripts for Postgresql and Informix are provided.
    * Set your environmental variables to connect to the database where the
    sql_catalog table was created. here are mine. And yes, the password is
    an empty string in my case.
         setenv SQL_CATALOG_DSN dbi:Pg:dbname=mydb
         setenv SQL_CATALOG_USR postgres
         setenv SQL_CATALOG_PAS 

    * Copy the sql_* scripts to a place on your $PATH
    * Let 'er rip.
